## Introduction

The Number Game is a text-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it. The player is provided with clues, and they can keep guessing until they correctly identify the number or reach a set number of attempts.

## Game Features

- Random number generation for each game.
- Player input for guessing the number.
- Clues to help the player make an educated guess.
- Score tracking to see how well you're doing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run The Number Game, you'll need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your computer.
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the program.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-number-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd the-number-game
   ```

## How to Play

1. The computer will generate a random number.
2. You will be prompted to guess the number.
3. You can make multiple guesses until you either guess the correct number or reach a predefined maximum number of attempts.
4. Clues will be provided to help you narrow down your guess.
5. Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible to improve your score.


## Theory and Concept

The game is designed to illustrate key programming concepts, such as:

- Random number generation.
- User input and validation.
- Conditional statements for game logic.
- Looping structures for multiple attempts.
- Score tracking and leaderboard.

The game can be used as a learning tool for those new to programming or C in particular.
